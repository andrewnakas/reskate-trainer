# Changelog

## Unreleased — Feel workshop

- Reorganize PHYSICS into Feel, Settings, Presets, Fun and Tools. Keep existing
  practice, map, telemetry and Skate 3 reference controls in their corresponding sections.
- Add Hardcore, Authentic, Stock, Accessible and Arcade references with a continuous
  stock-relative preview and explicit Apply. Respect direct and inherited locks and keep
  unrelated edits. Hardcore starts at 0.1x grind capture, 1.4x friction and 0.75x grind pop.
- Use full-width precise editors: labels above controls, commit after editing, Escape to
  cancel, and responsive layouts at narrow widths and larger UI scales. Keep 0.4.3's
  board-flip, catch and pump controls in Feel, with timed-catch priority over stored speeds.
- Lead Fun with Tricklining and reverts, then Jump heights and all 23 quick shortcuts
  in six collapsible categories. Add readable descriptions, ON/OFF states and active counts.
  Keep board bending in one place and replace inferred extras state with Apply/Restore actions.
- Review saved presets before applying; confirm replacement/deletion and broad resets.
  Preserve existing libraries and unknown imported keys. Bound imports and atomically
  replace profiles without deleting the last good save first.
- Publish coherent owner-bound Push, Pump and Revert commands, revalidate flip ownership
  before writes and keep reduced push targets within their current ceiling.
- Add native ImGui interaction/layout, Feel, physics-policy and preset/storage regressions.
  Fix the session-extras test stimulus while retaining valid 50x flip-speed support.

## v0.4.3 - 2026-10-07

Built on ReSkate 1.1.4 (0.4.2 was built on 1.1.3). The trainer itself is unchanged.

## v0.4.2 - 2026-10-07

- **Flip trick speed really sets the speed, both ways, and each trick can have its own.** The
  slider now multiplies the speed the trick's animation plays at while the board is in the air
  (the game state Float.Anim.TrickFlipSpeed), not the curves in front of it: x 0.5 is half
  speed, x 2 is double (faster than the game's own never worked before), for every flip trick,
  shuvits, 360 flips and varials included, and the pop is untouched. **Advanced trick speed**
  adds a speed for each of 16 tricks (kickflip, heelflip, the shuvits, varials, 360 flip, laser
  flip, hardflip, inward heelflip, impossibles; a nollie uses its regular trick's), multiplied
  with the main one. Presets carry them (`trick.flip.<trick>`, `trick.flip_advanced`).
- **A slow flip is slow from the start.** Below x 1 the game's finish-before-landing rule is held
  off by itself, so the board is not hurried round: with too little air you land on a board that
  is still turning. The switch "Let slow flips stay slow" of 0.4.1 is gone: this does its job
  (a preset that carries it still loads).
- **Pump power.** A new slider under TRICKS sizes what pumping a transition gives: 1 is the
  game's own, x 2 is about one more of the game's pumps on top of each of yours, x 10 and up is
  a rocket, under 1 takes speed away. The game's own pumping state (Bool.Intent.Pumping) says
  when you are pumping, and for every physics step it does the trainer adds speed along your
  travel (`trainer option pump_power <x>`, preset key `trick.pump_power`). Like the flip speed
  it is found about 15 seconds after a level loads. Off under a host's enforced physics or with
  boosts off. It replaces the dial "Pumping strength" (Pump Power), which changed nothing: the
  game's own gain is small (0.3 to 1 m/s a pump, measured) and fades the faster you already go.
- **Whole setups live at the bottom of MAP & HUD.** "Play like" (skate., Skate 3 Easy, Skate 3,
  Skate 3 Hardcore) and YOUR PRESETS moved there from TUNE: the setup you have now is saved under
  a name, turned on and off, shared as one line of text and imported from one (`trainer open
  presets`). TUNE keeps the presets that each change one thing (the dials and switches);
  TRICKLINING keeps its "Play like" row. Saving now also works when only a trick setting is
  changed.
- **The camera tab is gone.** The camera controls did not work reliably, so they are out of this
  version: the CAMERA tab, `trainer camera` and the saved camera numbers (ignored if present).
- **The dial "On foot: flip and roll speed" is gone.** It changed nothing in the game. The three
  values are still listed under EVERYTHING.
- **Far fewer memory searches.** Every bail builds a new skater and each one started a full search
  of the game's memory (about 13 seconds of a background thread), so a session of slow flips
  searched over and over. A search that a new skater asked for and that found nothing new now
  doubles the wait before the next (20 s up to 10 minutes); a level load or a real change puts it
  back.
- **It takes about 15 seconds after every level load.** The game loads its flip animation states
  with the level, and the trainer has to find them in memory again; until it has, the main
  slider falls back to the old, weaker way and the per-trick speeds do nothing. The TRICKS card
  says so while it is looking.
- **Catch flips at a set point of the jump** (TRICKS, for realism): a switch and a percent. Every
  flip trick is round and caught at that part of the air time, on a small ollie and a big one
  alike (options catch_at, catch_percent; presets carry them). The useful range is about 55 to 100.
- **A banner when the host controls physics.** In a multiplayer game whose host enforces physics a
  card above the tabs says the menu will not work there; another says so when the host has turned
  boosts off. The rules are unchanged.
- **Push speed goes past the game's ceiling.** The push class speeds never lifted the speed model's
  top speed (about 11 m/s whatever they were set to). A push is now carried on to the dialled
  speed on the physics step and held there for as long as the game holds a pushed speed.
- **Board bending boost: no more speed from ordinary 180s.** 0.4.1 also counted a landing whose
  board and body were together 12 degrees or more out of line with the travel. The game
  straightens plain short or crooked 180s (flip trick 180s too) that way, so they got a boost,
  and a bigger one than a real auto revert. That rule is now off as shipped ("or off the travel"
  reads "off" at 90): a bend is the board landing 40 degrees or more off your body, as in
  AutoRevertBoost. Settings saved by 0.4.1 with the old 12 are moved to off. Turn the rule on
  yourself and a landing that counts by it alone gets the auto revert boost at most. Found and
  measured by AutoRevertBoost's authors (Sivaes, jaq and OVM).

## v0.4.1 - 2026-10-06

Built on ReSkate 1.1.3. Everything of the 0.4.0 test build, plus:

- **Let slow flips stay slow.** The game speeds a flip trick up so the board is round 1/6 s before
  the landing it predicts, however slow the flip speed is set: that is why a slowed flip still
  came round on a small pop. The new switch under TRICKS turns that rule off (`trainer option
  flip_gate 0`): the board turns as slowly as set and lands however far round it got. It is saved
  and shared with your presets, and off under a host's enforced physics.
- **Help on everything.** Every button, slider and switch of the trainer says what it does when
  you point at it, and the tips wrap instead of running off the screen.

## v0.4.0 - 2026-10-06 (test build)

Built on ReSkate 1.1.3. From what players asked for in the ReSkate Discord. Everything marked "untested" is in so that it
can be tried: tell us what it does.

- **Camera tab.** Move the game's own cameras: distance, height and side for the low camera, the
  high camera and the on-foot camera, with a "SunJay's Low Cam" button (the numbers of SunJay's
  mod, which showed where the game keeps them). The cameras keep their smoothing and stay out of
  walls. Also an experimental camera of your own that replaces the game's.
- **Skate 3 presets.** Skate 3, Skate 3 Hardcore and Skate 3 Easy set every value this game still
  shares with Skate 3 by name (77 of them differ) to Skate 3's number: pop, grind pops, pushing,
  pumping, steering, manuals, body spins and flips, bails. Not yet measured against Skate 3.
- **Pop out of grinds, finished.** All six values are named (grinds, board slides, nose and tail
  slides; the highest pop and the quick-pop minimum) and one dial moves them together.
- **More dials:** on-board gravity, get-on-board speed (untested), body flip air time (untested),
  landing speed you can take, landing compression (untested), revert friction, pumping strength.
  Manual pop, the stick boost when popping, and the bad-landing strictness are named values.
- **Search finds everything:** dials, switches, trick sliders and every value, on all three lists.
- **The menu works from the controller.** LB + RB + click the right stick opens and closes it;
  D-pad or left stick moves, A presses, B goes back. It can be switched off on the Practice tab.
- **Share presets.** "Share" copies a preset as one line of text; "Import from clipboard" adds
  one someone sent you. Your own presets now carry the trick sliders too.
- **You can see when you are stock:** a line beside Reset everything says STOCK or MODIFIED.
- **Plainer words:** named values explain themselves, with units, when you point at them.
- **Flip trick speed keeps working, and slows flips properly.** The game builds its tuning objects
  again with a new skater (a respawn, a teleport, a session change) and they came back at its own
  numbers, so a slowed flip (and every value of the game's tuning classes: push speeds, on-foot
  values) quietly stopped applying. The trainer now checks once a second, writes back what the
  game undid and looks for the new objects. The slider also scales the three flick-influence
  curves it used to leave alone, which is why x0.4 only slowed a flip by a third. And below 1 it
  stretches the flip catch times by the same factor: the game hurries any flip that would not
  finish inside its catch time, so slowed flips used to snap back to full speed.
- **Tricklining** (a fourth list on the Tune tab). Everything tricklining needs in one place (reverts and powerslides,
  pumping, pops, spins and flips, manuals and grinds), under a "play like" choice:
  skate., Skate 3 Easy, Skate 3 or Skate 3 Hardcore (the choice heads every list of the Tune tab), plus
  Skate 3's tricklining extras. The revert boost's rules are yours to change there: how much spin
  counts, how far out of line the board must land, what each kind of revert is worth.
- **Skate 3 presets grind the older way.** They also set 21 grind and pumping values from the unused
  tuning set the game still carries (Skate 3's wherever the two can be compared): grind friction,
  slide angles, no automatic turning between grinds. Each tricklining card says what it is for.
- **Board bending boost** (TRICKS; it was first called the revert speed boost). Land a spin the game has to auto revert and get speed back, as
  earlier builds of the game did; chain reverts to build speed. 0 is off. The measuring and the
  numbers are AutoRevertBoost's, by Sivaes, jaq and OVM (github.com/Sivaes/AutoRevertBoost). It also
  counts the common revert theirs did not: board and body together landing out of line with the
  direction of travel.
- **No limits of the trainer's own.** A slider's ends are only where the slider stops: every value,
  dial, trick slider and camera number takes any typed number (flip trick speed 0.01 to 100, camera
  numbers have a box beside the slider).
- No comply and boneless heights now also apply to weak upward launches (riding downhill).
- The menu tab is called PHYSICS.

## In ReSkate

Changes made when the trainer moved into ReSkate itself.

- **Nothing happens until you ask.** The jump read-out and the controller shortcuts start off,
  jumps are written to the log only while the read-out or telemetry recording is on, and trick
  launches only when the trainer scaled them.
- **The memory search runs on demand.** It used to run for every player after a level loaded,
  and up to seven times when it found nothing. Now it runs once one of the tuning classes'
  values or the flip speed is changed (yours, or a host's you skate with), or the EVERYTHING list
  is open, and at most three times per level. It also runs again on each level for those
  players: a level brings fresh copies.
- **A host's whole setup reaches its guests.** While a session's host sets everyone's physics,
  guests get its class values, trick multipliers and auto push as well as its tuning, and their
  own stand down; a player who joins later gets them too. Before, only the tuning travelled, so
  a host could push or jump further than the guests it was holding to the game's own.
- **Guests are locked by the session's own switch**, from the moment they join, rather than by
  whether the host's tuning had arrived yet. A guest's class values also no longer come back
  after a map change in such a session.

## v0.3.0 - 2026-10-04

Built on ReSkate 1.0.7.

- **One Tune screen.** The Presets tab is gone: presets, trick sliders, your own presets and the
  values are one screen, still split into REALISTIC, FUN and EVERYTHING. They all show the same
  values, so a preset can no longer say "on" while a slider says something else.
- **Presets are dials.** Each built-in preset is a slider: 1 is the game's own, the preset's
  number is the preset as it shipped (Super Ollie = Ollie height x3), and anything between or
  beyond works. Below 1 turns the same things down, which is what the Realistic list is for.
  The preset's button still switches it on and off, and lights up whenever the values match
  it, whatever set them. `trainer dial <multiplier> <preset name>` from the console.
- **Reset everything**, above the tabs: every value, lock, preset and trick slider back to the
  game as it shipped. Locked values used to survive every reset (a locked ollie height kept
  Super Ollie alive), and the trick sliders had no reset at all. Each part also has its own:
  Reset values (keeps locks, and says how many), Reset tricks.
- **More values confirmed, by hand.** A player ground, pumped, climbed, vaulted and bailed while
  the trainer watched which values the game read: 56 more are confirmed (climbing 23, vault
  and mantle 10, the speed model 8, push 7, bails 5, grind control 3), 243 of 314 in all. The
  71 that were never read in any of it (all of pumping, the double-stick flip metrics, grind
  lean and transition, strong-impact bounces) stay listed as "no use found".
- **Type any number.** Every dial and trick slider has a box beside it: type a multiplier and
  press Enter to go past the slider's end (Ollie height x10000 if you like). Curve and graph
  multipliers and the trick heights no longer stop at x100.
- The short lists only show values the game was found or seen to read.
- Torpedo Boost no longer names a value the game does not have.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-10-04

Built on ReSkate 1.0.7.

- **Realistic, Fun and Everything.** The Tune tab opens on one of two short lists: REALISTIC
  (pop, push speeds, flip catch times, bail limits, on-foot jump and sprint, all draggable below
  the game's own values, with the Realistic preset one click away) and FUN (the big switches
  and everything on foot and in the air). EVERYTHING is the whole table with search.
  `trainer open realistic|fun|everything` opens them from the console.
- **The game's other tuning.** Much of the game is not tuned by its physics tuning asset but by
  data-defined classes: push speeds, on-foot jump, sprint, flips and rolls, wallrun, vault and
  mantle, dive, torpedo and glide, bail fall speeds, flip catch times, grind control, pumping,
  powerslide, the speed model. The trainer now finds 24 of them in memory (by the defaults and
  field order the game's data ships) and lists their 314 values by name, next to the 3801 of
  the tuning asset.
- **Push speed scales every push.** "Push speed" now drives the game's own push speeds (a
  tapped push, a held one, the top), so taps cruise faster or slower too. The three speeds are
  on the Realistic list by themselves. Measured: x2 cruises at 8.2 m/s from taps (4.0 stock),
  the Realistic preset at 3.0.
- **On foot:** jump height (also as a multiplier beside the trick heights), sprint speed, flip
  rotation and roll speed, wallrun boosts; in the air: glide gravity, air resistance and
  steering, torpedo and dive steering. New presets: Moon Jump, Fast On Foot, Fast Parkour
  Flips, Super Glide, Torpedo Boost. Measured: Moon Jump 0.9 m to 2.6 m, Fast On Foot 6.6 to
  9.8 m/s. The flip, glide, torpedo and dive values were not exercised by a test.
- **Powerslide** forward force and friction, for the speed tricks slides used to allow.
- Trick height sliders go from x0.1 to x50 (Ctrl+click to type); the console takes 0.05 to 100.
- Return after a bail no longer ignores the first bail of a session, and says in the log what
  it did. (The switch is on the Practice tab.)
- **Flip trick speed** (the TRICKS card). The game keeps board flip speed in eight curves; the
  trainer finds them and scales the four speed curves. It slows flips (x0.4: a kickflip turns at
  about 950 deg/s instead of 1300 to 1400); above 1 the game's own limit on how fast a board
  turns takes over, so the slider stops at x3.
- **Evidence behind every class value.** A scripted skater rode, pushed, ollied, flipped, did no
  complies and bonelesses, ran, jumped and sprinted while hardware read watches sat on every copy
  of each of the 314 values: the game read 187. The rest (grind control, pumping, climbing,
  vaults, hard impacts: moves the script does not do) are marked "no use found" and hidden unless
  asked for, like the tuning asset's unread values.
- **A locked value keeps what it drives.** Stock and Reset all used to leave a locked ollie
  height showing its number while resetting the graphs behind it.
- The jump read-out, the log and the telemetry CSV carry the board's fastest turn rate.
- Checked by measurement, with a scripted controller: push speed (x2 cruises at 8.2 m/s, the
  Realistic preset at 3.0), auto push, ollie height, Mega Pop (0.39 to 0.79 m), Fast Spins, no
  comply and boneless heights, on-foot jump (Moon Jump 0.9 to 2.6 m), sprint (Fast On Foot 6.6
  to 9.8 m/s), flip trick speed, game speed (0.5x doubles an ollie's air time), markers and
  their pad shortcuts, teleport. No effect could be measured for the speed wobble start speed
  (heading at 7.5 m/s) or the sideways bail limit (0.01 did not cause a bail); spread-eagle,
  torpedo, on-foot flips, grinds, bails and return-after-bail were not reached by the script.

## v0.1.4 - 2026-10-03

- **No comply height and boneless height.** Two new sliders beside the hippy jump's (Tune tab,
  top of Essentials, and the Presets tab). The game's trick scripts launch these jumps; the
  trainer multiplies the launch where the game sets the jump's trajectory, so the skater and
  the board go up together. Measured: no comply 0.50 m stock, 1.70 m at x4; boneless 0.46 m
  stock, 3.39 m at x9. Console: `trainer option nocomply_height|boneless_height <x>`.
- **Top pushing speed works.** The game skips its own push tuning (pushes aim for speeds the
  trick scripts pick), so the value did nothing. Now, holding push carries on past the game's
  9.1 m/s to your number, and a lower number caps pushing. Taps still cruise at the game's
  4 m/s. The Fast and Realistic presets use it.
- **Auto push works.** The game hands its auto push flag to the animation and nothing comes of it
  (measured: the same coast-down with it on). With it on, a rolling skater that is not braking
  now gains speed up to the auto push speed (8 m/s; both are on the Essentials list).
- **Push strength is hidden:** nothing in this game build reads it while pushes are scripted.
- Checked without a player, with a scripted controller: marker pad shortcuts (LB+RB+Up saves,
  LB+RB+Down returns), ollie height, Fast Spins.

## v0.1.3 - 2026-10-03

- **Hippy jump height.** A slider on the Tune tab (top of Essentials) and the Presets tab. The game
  sets this jump in its trick scripts, not in its tuning, so the trainer recognises a hippy jump
  starting and scales the skater's upward speed.
- **Realistic preset:** lower pop, slower pushing and rotation, earlier speed wobble, easier bails.
- **Spin and flip in the jump read-out:** degrees turned about the vertical (and the peak rate) and
  degrees the body tumbled, in the HUD card, the Map & HUD tab and the log.
- More tuning values are recognised as used: the table now also includes everything the game read
  in traced play sessions (584 of 930 rows, was 527).
- No comply and boneless heights are not adjustable yet: the game drives those jumps along a
  scripted path that a velocity change does not move.

## v0.1.2 - 2026-10-03

- **Tune no longer offers values that do nothing.** A pass over the game's code found which tuning
  values it reads (527 of the 930 rows). The rest, including the Mode ollie heights and the hippy
  jump heights people tried, are hidden unless you tick "Values with no use found", and are marked.
- **Ollie height and body spin speed are plain values again.** The game ignores its own
  `JumpMaxHeight`, `JumpMinHeight` and `MaxSpinSpeed`; the trainer now links them to the graphs the
  game does read, so setting ollie height to twice its stock value doubles the jump graphs.
- The Essentials list only holds values that do something: ollie height, body flip speed, body
  spin speed, pushing speed, grind lock-on and more.
- A preset says when it skipped values you locked.
- Every preset can be switched off again by itself; presets that are still on keep their values.
- Presets no longer contain rules for values the game does not read. Mega Pop and No Speed Wobble
  were rebuilt on the ones it does.
- The Tune tab says that changes apply as you drag and that the box only locks a value.

## v0.1.1 - 2026-10-03

Packaging only (Thunderstore): `Install.bat` and `Uninstall.bat`. The trainer was unchanged.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-10-03

First release, built on ReSkate 1.0.3.

- TRAINER page in the ReSkate menu: Tune, Presets, Practice, Map & HUD.
- Live editing of the game's physics tuning (3,801 values, 89 curves, 80 graphs), named from the
  player's own game data; search, groups, an Essentials list, freeze, reset.
- Quick switches: super high ollie, fast flips (front and back flips), fast spins, never bail.
- Stackable presets, user presets, a preset per map.
- Game speed and pause, five marker slots per map, return after a bail, teleport.
- Speed / air HUD and a read-out after every jump; telemetry recording to CSV.
